          What is NSC?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>National Savings Certificate (NSC)</strong> is a safe and reliable
          investment option for individuals seeking to grow their savings while
          also benefiting from tax deductions. It is ideal for risk-averse
          investors and taxpayers who want to reduce their taxable income.
          Despite its lock-in period and taxable interest, NSC remains a solid
          choice for fixed returns and government-backed security.

          Interest Rates on NSC
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The interest rate on National Savings Certificates (NSC) is fixed by
          the government and is subject to periodic revisions. Currently, the
          interest rate for a 5-year NSC is around 6.8% per annum
          (subject to change based on the government's decision).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The interest on NSC is compounded annually, meaning interest is added
          to the principal every year and earns more interest in subsequent
          years. The total interest is paid at maturity.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Section 80C Deduction:</strong> The principal amount
            invested in NSC is eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C,
            allowing you to save up to ₹1.5 lakh annually.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taxable Interest:</strong> While the principal investment
            qualifies for tax deduction, the interest earned on NSC is taxable
            under "Income from Other Sources".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TDS (Tax Deducted at Source):</strong> NSC does not deduct
            TDS, but the interest is taxable, and the investor must declare it
            while filing tax returns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interest Reinvestment Benefit:</strong> The interest added
            to the principal amount is eligible for tax deduction under Section
            80C, making it a valuable option for tax planning.

          How Does NSC Work?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          After purchasing the National Savings Certificate (NSC) at a Post
          Office, the amount you invest earns a fixed interest rate compounded
          annually. The interest is added to the principal every year and is
          paid out only at maturity (after 5 years).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          For example, if you invest ₹1,000 in NSC at an interest rate of 6.8%,
          the interest is calculated every year on the total principal. At the
          end of the 5-year tenure, you will receive the total principal along
          with compounded interest.
